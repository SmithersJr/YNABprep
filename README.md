## Reconfigure bank account transaction downloads for import into [YNAB 4](http://www.youneedabudget.com)

My initial script was AppleScript (Mac-only). I plan to rewrite it in Python for cross-platform compatibility.

YNAB has introduced a new online version that will import directly from banks; but, I still plan to rewrite this in Python for the experience.
